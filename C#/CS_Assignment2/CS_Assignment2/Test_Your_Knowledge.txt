C# Assignment-2

### Test Your Knowledge Questions ###

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
`String` is immutable, meaning every operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string. `StringBuilder` is mutable, allowing in-place modifications, which makes it more efficient for scenarios that require frequent changes to a string.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays in C# is `System.Array`.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
We can sort an array in C# using the `Array.Sort(arrayName)` method.

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
`Array.Length`.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No, you cannot store multiple data types in an array directly. However, if you declare the array as `object[]`, you can store different data types because all types in C# derive from `System.Object`.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
     - System.Array.CopyTo(): Requires an existing destination array and copies elements starting at a specific index in the destination array.
     - System.Array.Clone(): Creates a new array that is a shallow copy of the original array without requiring an existing destination array.
