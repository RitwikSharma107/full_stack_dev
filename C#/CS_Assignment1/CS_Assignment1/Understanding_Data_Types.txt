### Understanding Data Types ###

1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number: string because it might contain country code with +1
A person’s height: float/double
A person’s age: int
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer): string
A person’s salary: decimal
A book’s ISBN: string
A book’s price: decimal
A book’s shipping weight: float/double
A country’s population: long
The number of stars in the universe: long
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the
United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business): int

2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing?

Value Type
•	Stored in stack memory
•	Can not be collected by garbage collector
•	Directly hold the value
•	Created by struct/enum
•	Can not accept NULL values 
 
Reference Type
•	Stored in heap memory
•	Can be collected by garbage collector
•	Hold memory_address/reference of the variable
•	Created by string/array/class/interface/delegate
•	Can accept NULL values

Boxing: The process of converting a value type to a reference type by wrapping it inside an object. 
For example, converting an int to an object.

Unboxing: The process of converting a reference type back to a value type. 
For example, converting an object back to an int.


3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET

Managed Resources:
Resources that are handled by the .NET runtime's garbage collector (GC).

Unmanaged Resources:
Resources that the .NET GC does not handle and require explicit cleanup.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
•	Automatic Memory Management
•	Prevents Memory Leaks
•	Optimizes Memory Usage
•	Handles Object Lifetimes
