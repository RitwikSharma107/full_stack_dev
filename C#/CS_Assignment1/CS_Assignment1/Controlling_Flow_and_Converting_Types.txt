### Controlling Flow and Converting Types ###

1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0? 
Error: Division by constant zero

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
No Error: Results in either positive or negative infinity

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?
Error: Cannot implicitly convert type 'long' to 'int'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
    •	x = y++ (postfix increment operator) 
        x is assigned the value of y before y is incremented
    •	x = ++y (prefix increment operator) 
        y is incremented first, and then x is assigned the value of y

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
•	break: Exits the loop immediately and transfers control to the statement following the loop.
•	continue: Skips the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.
•	return: Exits the entire method immediately and returns control to the caller method, optionally returning a value.

6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
    1.	Initialization: Executed once before the loop starts.
    2.	Condition: Evaluated before each iteration; if false, the loop exits.
    3.	Iteration: Executed at the end of each loop iteration.
All three parts are optional, but at least the condition part should be there to avoid an infinite loop if no break condition is provided.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
= (Assignment operator): Assign a value to a variable.
== (Equality operator): Compare two values for equality.

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
Yes, this statement compiles. It creates an infinite loop because the condition true is always true, and the loop has no body due to the semicolon (;)

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
It represents the default case, i.e., when no other pattern matches

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach
statement?
An object must implement the IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> interface to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement
