1. Describe the problem generics address.
   - Generics address the problem of code duplication and type safety. 
   - They allow developers to write a class, method, or interface that can work with any data type without sacrificing type safety. 
   - This means that you can create more flexible and reusable code while avoiding runtime errors that arise from type mismatches.

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
   -> List<string> stringList = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
   The Dictionary class has two generic type parameters: TKey and TValue.

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
   False. The type parameters of a generic class can be different and do not need to match.

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
   The Add method is used to add items to a List object.
   -> list.Add(item);

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
   - Remove
   - RemoveAt

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
   You indicate that a class has a generic type parameter by using angle brackets (< >) after the class name with the type parameter inside.
   public class GenericClass<T> {   }

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
   False

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
   True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
    True
